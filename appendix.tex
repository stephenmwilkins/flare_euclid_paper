With one visible and 3 near-infrared bands \euclid\ provides the ability to robustly identify galaxies at high-redshift $z>6$ via the Lyman-$\alpha$/limit break. To demonstrate \euclid's capabilities we run a simple simulation in which we generate synthetic photometry assuming a simple $\beta$ model. In this model the underlying rest-frame ultraviolet spectrum is described by a simple power-law: $L_{\nu}\propto \lambda^{\beta+2}$ with ISM/IGM abosorption described by MADAU96.

We then add noise assuming the \euclid\ point-source depths and use the {\sc eazy} \insref\ photometric redshift code.

The solid line shows the median value of $\Delta z$ while the shaded region shows the central 68\% range. Input models assume a uniform distribution of UV continuum slopes $\beta\in[-3,0]$ and luminosities. Only galaxies with ${\rm S/N(H)}=5-20$ are included in the figure.\label{fig:beta_dz}}
